## Abstract
Metal-organic framework (MOF) derived materials formed via high temperature processes show great potential as catalysts. Understanding of structure-property relationships between the initial MOF and resulting MOF derived catalyst is limited, as their amorphous nature challenges standard characterisation methods. Neural network approaches, that learn interatomic potentials from density functional theory, offer a promising approach.
