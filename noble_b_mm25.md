## Abstract
Metal complexes exhibiting rare oxidation states are at the frontier of catalytic and medical applications, including C–H activation, photochemical water splitting and anti‐tumour therapies. A common strategy for stabilizing such oxidation states is via bridging frameworks, which facilitate the formation of dinuclear species with metal–metal bonds. The [Au2X2(μ‐ArPR2)2] family, first synthesised ~30 years ago (Fig. 1), exemplifies this: two Au(II) atoms bridged by diphosphines, readily tuned by modifying X, Ar and R substituents. In this study, we employ quantum mechanical and hybrid methodologies to explore their thermal and photochemical reactivity. We reveal new pathways that elucidate the extraordinary rearrangements these species undergo, reconciling contradictory reports of their stability. These insights resolve a decades‐old puzzle and pave the way for designing novel dinuclear dimers for advanced applications.
