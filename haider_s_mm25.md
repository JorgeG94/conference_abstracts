## Abstract 

G-quadruplexes (G4) are widely distributed higher-order structures in 
nucleic acids. Their potential involvement in various biological 
processes have attracted enormous interest. Due to G4 polymorphism, it 
is challenging to predict topologies of potential G4-forming sequences 
(pG4 or PQS) based on strand geometry and the conformation of 
guanine residues in quartets. Besides, G4 structures are highly stable, 
so the core dynamics is undifferentiated between different 
polymorphisms. A deep neural network, Convolutional Variational 
Autoencoder (CVAE), is applied to the grouping of G4 structures to 
investigate the similarities/differences between their dynamics 
characterized by ligand, sequence, and topology. The CVAE method 
captures characteristics of the investigated G4 dynamics and 
compresses them into a low-dimensional latent space in a discrete 
manner.
