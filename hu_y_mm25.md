## Abstract
The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 is a validated therapeutic target for neuroinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Most Kv1.x channels are homotetramers of identical subunits, but Kv1.x subunits can also form heterotetrameric complexes. Many venom-derived peptides are promising Kv1.3 inhibitors, but their activity toward physiologically relevant heterotetramers is not well understood. In this study, we used whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology to evaluate the inhibitory activity of the peptide Vm24 against Kv1.3/Kv1.x heterotetramers (Kv1.1–Kv1.6). We built structural models of representative heterotetramers using AlphaFold-Multimer, and docked Vm24 to these heterotetramers. This combined experimental and computational approach provides insights into how Kv1.3-selective inhibitors interact with heteromeric Kv1.x channels and supports the design of next-generation Kv1.3-targeted peptides with improved selectivity.
