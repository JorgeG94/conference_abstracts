## Abstract
The mechanism by which sucrose and other sugars interact with lipid bilayers depends on concentration and hydration. Molecular dynamics simulations of DOPC:cholesterol (CHOL) bilayers under full and dehydrated states probed the influence of CHOL on this interaction. Interfacial sucrose rises with concentration; under dehydration it preferentially fills the interlamellar space. CHOL condenses bilayers and dampens the disordering effect of sucrose. In 2DOPC:1CHOL bilayers, the increase in lateral expansion reaches a maximum by a 1sucrose:2lipid ratio, whereas at a 1:1.23 ratio it decreases despite strong sucrose accumulation, consistent with saturation of headgroup binding and a crossover toward interlamellar exclusion. The mechanism of action of sucrose was again confirmed to be hydration- and concentration-dependent, but with CHOL shifting the crossover from a water-replacement to a hydration forces mechanism at lower concentrations.
