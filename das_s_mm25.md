## Abstract
γ-Secretase is a multi-subunit intramembrane protease complex that plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease by processing the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and other substrates. The detailed molecular mechanisms underlying its substrate recognition and cleavage specificity remain incompletely understood. This project employs advanced all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, including enhanced sampling techniques, with the construction of realistic models of γ-secretase embedded in a lipid bilayer, complexed with various substrate peptides, including wild-type and familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) mutants can be done to analyze simulation trajectories that reveals key conformational states, interaction networks that govern substrate selection. The results provide mechanistic insights into how γ-secretase distinguishes between different substrates and how specific mutations alter its function.
