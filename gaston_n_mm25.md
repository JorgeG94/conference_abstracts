## Abstract
A question of fundamental importance to the study of low-temperature
Liquid Metals motivates this study: why does gallium have such a low
melting temperature, of 29.8 degrees Celsius, in the first place?
Recent first-principles simulations have demonstrated that, in contrast to
previous assumptions, covalent bonding becomes more important in the
liquid at higher temperatures. This suggests that the change of enthalpy
upon the change from solid to liquid phase is not anomalous, and that
instead the entropy difference between the dimeric solid and monatomic
liquid explains the room temperature (on a nice day) melting point [1].
