## Abstract 

While chemists have long used electrical potentials to control redox processes, our recent work has shown that electric fields can also catalyze non-redox reactions. This “electrostatic catalysis” arises when an oriented field selectively stabilizes the transition state, accelerating reaction rates. Because these effects are highly directional, a central challenge is controlling molecular orientation within the field. One experimental approach is to use scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) to deliver electric fields, align molecules, and measure their impact on single-molecule reaction rates [1]. However, STM is not scalable for bulk chemical synthesis. To overcome this limitation, we have introduced a scalable approach that harnesses the internal electric fields of charged functional groups [2]. Here, protonation or deprotonation switches the local field at the reaction site, providing a convenient pH-controlled handle on reactivity. Using this strategy, we have stabilized reactive intermediates, controlled regio- and stereoselectivity, enhanced and red-shifted photochemical processes, and lowered reaction temperatures by as much as 150 °C [3]. This talk will highlight these advances and our broader efforts to establish electrostatic catalysis as a powerful new paradigm for organic synthesis.
