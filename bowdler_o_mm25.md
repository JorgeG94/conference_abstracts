## Abstract
Ferroelectric control of the surface chemistry bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) presents the possibility for the selective absorption and desorption of oxygen atoms at various potentials. As the pseudocubic (001) surface of R3c bismuth ferrite may be manipulated by variation of the Bi3+ ion’s position close or far from the Fe2Ox surface in response to an external electric field, it may be possible to dynamically adjust reaction potentials. This may present a pathway for a metal oxide surface to be utilised as a combined catalyst and redox agent, with a focus on water splitting and aqueous reactions.
