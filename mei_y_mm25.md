## Abstract
Population growth and technological innovation are driving increased demand for critical metals, which are essential for sustainable future. Meeting this demand requires predictive models that explain ore formation and modification, particularly dissolution, precipitation and metal transport in geo-fluids under varying temperature, pressure and chemical conditions. This project combines quantum mechanics, ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) and machine learning MD to predict speciation, crystal structures, interfacial behaviour and spectroscopic properties. These simulations are integrated with experimental studies and thermodynamic modelling to identify controlling factors and rate-limiting steps. This approach links molecular processes to ore formation and extraction strategies, providing insights that improve exploration and metallurgical design. This work advances computational geochemistry and builds lasting capability for sustainable resource development in Australia.
