## Abstract
The profound use of wireless technology has led to increased exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs), raising concerns over the side effects of non-thermal stress on biological tissues. Our combined in vitro and in silico study showed that the structural integrity a POPC model membrane is susceptible to an 18 GHz frequency EMF, resulting in membrane thinning and adsorption of silica nanosphere. In this study, we extended our previous work by applying molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effects of 18 GHz EMF exposure on the structural and dynamic properties of the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. The results indicated membrane thinning and increased fluidity of the bilayer. There is also an increased density of water and sodium ions within the membrane, contributing to the stability of the lipid bilayer.  Overall, the findings provide deeper understanding into the mechanism by which high-frequency EMFs alter the biophysical properties of the E. coli inner membrane.
