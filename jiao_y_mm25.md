## Abstract
The conversion of green electricity into chemicals and fuels through electrocatalysis provides a path towards a sustainable future. A central challenge in electrocatalysis remains the availability of catalyst materials that are both highly active and selective. Molecular modelling has helped by offering insights into reaction mechanisms and guiding material design. Increasingly, artificial intelligence is playing a transformative role in this space. AI models trained on quantum mechanical data or experimental results can rapidly screen material candidates, identify structure-performance relationships, and uncover hidden patterns that may not be obvious through conventional approaches.
