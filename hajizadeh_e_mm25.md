## Abstract
Multidrug resistance threatens global health, driving need for novel antimicrobials. Structurally nanoengineered antimicrobial peptide polymers (SNAPPs) are star-shaped polymers with dendritic cores and copeptide arms showing sub-μM efficacy against bacteria. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated SNAPP mechanisms across different sequences (alt-block, ran-block, diblock) and lipidation (C6, C12, C18 fatty acids) against bacterial and mammalian membranes. Alt-block and random SNAPPs formed step-by-step pores in bacterial membranes. Lipidation enhanced α-helical stability and membrane insertion, with C12-SNAPP optimal and C18-SNAPP less effective due to excessive hydrophobicity. SNAPPs selectively bound bacterial membranes via electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids while excluded from cholesterol-rich mammalian membranes. These insights enable optimization of next-generation antimicrobials through strategic design.
