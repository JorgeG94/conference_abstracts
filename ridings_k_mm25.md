## Abstract
Resistive random access memory (RRAM) devices operate via the growth and dissolution of conducting nanofilaments between two electrodes. These essentially form tiny atomic switches, where a change in the observed resistance will put the device in an ON or OFF state. Understanding the mechanisms that dictate this process is crucial in the design of scalable devices to be used in practical applications. In this work, we model and predict the growth of these nanofilaments in atomic switch systems using molecular dynamics simulations and artificial neural networks.
