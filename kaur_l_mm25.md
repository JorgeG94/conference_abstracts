## Abstract
The chemistry of heterocyclic ring systems has attracted much interest in recent times, including their reactivity, electronic structure, and application. The work presented here is focused on an investigation of phosphorus heterocyclic carbenes (PHCs). A range of computational chemistry tools have been utilised to understand the chemical properties of these novel compounds. Replacement of N by P in NHC offers the ability to tune the properties of the carbene ligand, however it is notable that that structure around P is pyramidalized (sp3) rather than planar (sp2) that limits interaction from P to the empty pz orbital of the carbene C atom. We have explored the effect of adding bulky groups to the P arom to circumvent pyramidalization. We have also explored the potential of PHCs to act as donor ligands.
