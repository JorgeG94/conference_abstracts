## Abstract

Phosphoinositides-biphosphates (PIP₂) are minor, negatively charged
membrane lipids that play critical roles in modulating many membrane
proteins. However, where PIP₂ binds and how it modifies ion channel
function remain unclear for most proteins. We present an automated
Coarse-Grained MD simulation PIPeline to predict PIP₂ binding sites in a
high-throughput manner. Using this, we evaluated CGMD’s performance
against experimental data and AI tools. In a validation set of 12 resolved
ion channel–PIP₂ complexes, PIP₂ the binding site could be reproduces
when PIP₂ starts in the bulk membrane. Binding sites can be identified
using quantitative metrics like duration and clustering. Compared to AI
tools, CGMD was more reliable for proteins with few structures and
poorly understood mechanisms. Finally, we predicted PIP₂ sites in
channels with known regulation but unresolved binding, offering insights
into lipid-protein interactions and lipid-like drug development.
