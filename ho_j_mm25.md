## Abstract 
A common problem faced by computational chemists is the trade-off between accuracy and speed in their simulations. In this talk, I will share some of the progress we have made in hybrid quanutm mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and many-body expansion methods to accelerate quanutm chemistry calculations. In the second part of the talk, I will briefly discuss how to efficiently compute free energies at interfaces, its relationship with amphiphilicity - an important property in drug-design and self-assembly.
