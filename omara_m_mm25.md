## Abstract

Biocompatible polymers are increasingly important in precision
nanomedicine, with applications ranging from vaccine adjuvants, drug
conjugation, theragnostic, and anti-biofouling of medical devices.
Molecular dynamics simulations are an invaluable tool for understanding
the molecular interactions of polymers with biological molecules, and as
a means of rational design and modify polymer/biomolecule binding
interactions. However, the diversity of polymer architectures makes
standardized modelling and MD simulation approaches challenging. This
is particularly true for biocompatible polymers, where a key bottleneck is
the lack of a comprehensive and generalizable method that streamlines
the preparation of novel polymer chemistries and architectures for
biomolecular MD simulation packages. Here we present PolyConstruct:
a generalizable computational framework that adapts the Gromacs
biomolecular simulation pipeline to generate chemically accurate
simulations of complex polymer architectures and chemistries. We
highlight the utility and robustness of PolyConstruct using examples of
linear, branched, star and dendritic polymers of user-defined tacticity
and chemistry, demonstrating its robustness for investigating complex
polymer architectures and biocompatible polymer simulations.
