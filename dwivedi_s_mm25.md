## Abstract
Advances in material fabrication techniques have revolutionised our ability to engineer nanomaterials with precision, which are driving innovations across catalysis, energy, and environmental applications. Understanding their response to physicochemical constraints and synthesis mechanisms often requires mapping structure-property relationships at various lengths and time scales. This talk explores the potential of large-scale reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF) simulations in bridging nano- to micro-scales. Key examples include the thermal decomposition of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) into highly active catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation, the development of materials for plasma-facing components in nuclear fusion reactors, and the understanding of 2D material synthesis. This talk will also provide an overview of computational methodologies available to a computational chemist, emphasising the development and application of ReaxFF MD simulations in material design.
