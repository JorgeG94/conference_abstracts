## Abstract
Most protein dynamics are a critical elements of their function and correspond to conformational changes in response to external stimuli or to thermal fluctuations between functional metastable states. From a drug development perspective, we can exploit protein dynamics and cryptic pockets[1] (ligand binding sites that only exist transiently) to
