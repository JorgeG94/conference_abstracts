## Abstract
Identifying chemical signs of life on other planets is crucial to the search for extraterrestrial life. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) collects infrared spectra which contain unique signals of different molecules present in the atmosphere of the exoplanet. Complete, high-temperature reference data is required to interpret this observed spectrum; however, this high-accuracy data (such as ExoMol line lists) currently exist for only 91 molecules. On the other hand, the quantum chemistry approach to approximating IR spectra of thousands of biologically relevant molecules lacks the necessary accuracy and detail to make confident molecular detections. My project explores the range of accuracy levels by approximating line list data and assessing how this impacts molecular detectability.  By determining the level of detail necessary for reliable molecular identification, this work aims to improve high-throughput computational approaches for predicting IR spectra.
