# Abstract: Polydopamine (PDA) is a black, biomimetic polymer synthesised through the self-polymerisation of dopamine, exhibiting superior properties including high biocompatibility, antimicrobial activity, and a unique ability to form functional coatings regardless of substrate chemistry. Yet, its polymerisation mechanism and structure have remained elusive since 2007 due to its insolubility in conventional solvents.

## Abstract
Polydopamine (PDA) is a black, biomimetic polymer synthesised through the self-polymerisation of dopamine, exhibiting superior properties including high biocompatibility, antimicrobial activity, and a unique ability to form functional coatings regardless of substrate chemistry. Yet, its polymerisation mechanism and structure have remained elusive since 2007 due to its insolubility in conventional solvents.
