## Abstract
A new calcium phosphate-based conservation treatment has been developed to mitigate corrosion of marble cultural heritage objects. Unfortunately, the coating suffers from micro-cracks and pores, which reduce its efficacy. Organic solvents like ethanol, isopropanol, and acetone reduce the occurrence of these microcracks and pores. The underlying mechanism, however, remains unknown. Previous computational investigations have focused on a pristine calcite surface and its interaction with water and the organic solvents. However, real calcite contains defects, like stepped edges and impurities, which significantly change the surface behavior. Hence, a study of solvent behavior on these defects is essential.
