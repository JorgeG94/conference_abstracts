## Abstract
Nanobody-based quenchbodies are emerging tools for sensitive biomolecular detection (Dong & Ueda, Sensors 2021; El Salamouni et al., FEBS Open Bio 2025). Recent quenchbodies targeting interleukin-6 (IL6) show variable fluorescence despite similar antigen binding (Cater et al., Commun Biol 2025). To probe this discrepancy, we combined structural predictions with molecular dynamics simulations. Benchmarking nanobody–lysozyme complexes showed HelixFold3 outperforms AlphaFold3. We then modelled IL6-binding quenchbodies, which lack experimental structures, to compare high- and low-performing variants from in vitro directed evolution. Poor responders displayed solvent-exposed tryptophans, particularly Trp110 upon antigen binding, enabling fluorophore quenching and reducing fluorescence. Good responders buried these residues, yielding stronger signals. Integrating HelixFold3 and molecular simulations provides mechanistic insight into quenchbody performance and guides rational sensor design.
