## Abstract
Using AIMD and thermodynamic integration (TI), we probed the speciation and pKa of H2SO3 at 25-350°C in bulk liquid and water nanodroplets. In bulk (25 & 100°C), H2SO3 rapidly ionizes to HSO3- (+ H3O+), and dissociates to SO2+H2O at 150°C, but remains fully associated at 350°C. In (H2O)100 (25-100°C), interior-solvated H2SO3 deprotonates readily to HSO3-, while surface-solvated H2SO3 remains fully protonated. TI-derived H2SO3 pKa aligns well with experiments: 25°C pK1=1.69 (Exp.=1.88 [1]), pK2=7.23 (Exp.=7.12 [2]). At 350°C, acidities of H2SO3 and HSO3- are reduced, with pK1=5.85, pK2=12.99. In H2SO3(H2O)100, surface H2SO3 ionization requires 2.6-4.6 kcal/mol more in ΔG compared to droplet interior ionization. Overall, at neutral pH in bulk liquid, our AIMD results here demonstrate that HSO3- predominates, while hydrothermal nanodroplet surfaces stabilise neutral H2SO3, whereas droplet interiors favor HSO3-.
