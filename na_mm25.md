## Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as an excellent host material for bright single-photon emitters. Experimental and computational studies associate single-photon emitters (SPEs) in hBN mainly with carbon defects. The lack of first-principles calculations on these defects at finite temperatures and with sufficiently large supercell sizes hinders the establishment of a consensus on potential candidates for quantum technology applications. Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) are a very accurate tool for finite-temperature simulations because they can be trained to accurately reproduce first-principles energies and forces in different scenarios.  Herein, the objective of this project is to exploit MLFFs to accelerate the study of these materials and simulate more realistic scenarios that could strengthen the connection between computational investigations and experiments.
