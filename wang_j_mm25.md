## Abstract
Enzyme catalysis depends not only on static structure but also on conformational dynamics. Traditional crystallography provides high-resolution snapshots yet often misses transient, functionally relevant motions. To address this, we applied ensemble-based molecular dynamics simulations to ketosteroid isomerase (KSI), whose catalytic efficiency arises from the distribution and interconversion of conformational states. Simulations under varied conditions (temperature, environment, force field, and mutation) were analysed through clustering, rotameric states, and hydrogen-bonding patterns, and benchmarked against experimental structures. Results show that mutations can sensitise the active site to temperature, altering flexibility within its hydrogen-bond network. This comparative framework demonstrates how conformational ensemble analysis deepens understanding of enzymatic function beyond static views.
