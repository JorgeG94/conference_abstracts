## Abstract
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising alternatives to traditional antibiotics in combating antimicrobial resistance, a major global health threat. These peptides act by disrupting microbial membranes and inhibiting essential intracellular processes. However, searching for potential AMPs remains challenging due to the vast diversity of possible peptide sequences. This project applies machine learning (ML) to predict AMP activity and design new candidates with improved properties. By integrating protein structure prediction tools and quantum mechanical descriptors such as electron density, the project aims to enhance model accuracy and uncover electronic structural features underlying AMPs activity. The presentation will explore the performance of ML approaches, discuss limitations of current descriptors, and outline strategies for developing ML models that can predict and generate novel AMPs with desired activity, contributing to the global fight against antimicrobial resistance.
