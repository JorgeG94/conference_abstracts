## Abstract 

Concentrated electrolytes are ubiquitous throughout the physical,
chemical and biological sciences. Over the last decade, experiments1
have shown that the screening lengths in concentrated electrolytes can
be orders of magnitude larger than those predicted by classical theory2
–
so-called ‘anomalous’ underscreening. We present here new insights
into the origins of anomalous underscreening derived from quantum
chemistry and molecular dynamics simulations, in concentrated aqueous
electrolytes, ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents. Anomalous
underscreening is observed directly using a novel multi-modal ansatz for
describing the electrostatic potential in bulk electrolytes. We show that
long-range decay lengths are associated with decay modes that oscillate
with periods on the scale of 1-1.5 nm in the bulk electrolytes.3 Classical
molecular dynamics simulations provide suggest that such oscillations
arise from correlated ion aggregates above the Kirkwood point.
However, the lifetime of these aggregates is ion-specific,4 and quantum
chemical simulations of hypersaline electrolytes indicates that the
electron density is highly non-local, persisting over nanometre length
scales. We discuss the implication of this result in the context of
underscreening and the concept of ion-size as applied to concentrated
electrolytes.
