## Abstract
The aggregation of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) into β-sheet-rich oligomers contributes to β-cell failure in type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereas rat IAPP (rIAPP) is largely non-amyloidogenic despite sequence similarity. Osmolytes such as glucose, glycerol, and sorbitol influence the folding of intrinsically disordered proteins in a concentration-dependent manner but the molecular mechanism remain unclear. Well-tempered bias-exchange metadynamics simulations revealed that hIAPP exhibits reduced α-helical content within its amyloidogenic core in the presence of osmolytes, suggesting destabilisation of aggregation-prone states. Minimal hydrogen bonding was observed between osmolytes and peptides, suggesting an osmophobic exclusion mechanism. These findings highlight how osmolytes modify the conformational landscapes of hIAPP and rIAPP through exclusion from the protein surface, reducing aggregation-prone states and potentially mitigating cytotoxicity.
