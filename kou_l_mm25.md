## Abstract 

In this talk, I will present two recent studies that integrate density
functional theory (DFT), machine learning potentials, and deep learning
molecular dynamics (DLMD) simulations to investigate ferroelectric
domain formation and dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate the
creation and manipulation of polar domains in ferroelectric In₂Se₃
through localized deformation, and in twisted bilayers of CuInP₂S₆.
Unlike the polar vortices and skyrmions reported in (PbTiO₃)n/(SrTiO₃)n
superlattices, the mechanisms here arise from stacking- or strain-
dependent energy barriers for ferroelectric switching, as well as
variations in switching speeds under thermal fluctuations. Importantly,
the thermal stability and polarization lifetimes are found to be highly
sensitive to curvature, twist angle, and temperature, and can be further
tuned by external electric fields and strain.
