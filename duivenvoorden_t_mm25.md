## Abstract
Designing and investigating new sustainable materials for batteries is essential to supporting the adoption of renewable energy. The electrolyte is crucial in optimizing battery performance, as it must be compatible with both electrodes and facilitate the fast transport of ions across the cell. Polymer-based electrolytes are a promising avenue for electrode stability, however, slow diffusion through these materials limits cell performance. Tuning the structure and composition of both solid and gel polymer electrolytes is required to optimize the ionic conductivity of these materials. This work has used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study a series of polymer-based systems with Mg2+ salts, and the addition of different amounts of solvents to screen for effective electrolytes for Magnesium Ion Batteries. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations have also been used to evaluate the ionic conductivity and performance of these polymer-based materials.
