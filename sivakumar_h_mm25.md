## Abstract
Bis-ligated aryl-λ3-iodanes (ArIL2) offer a sustainable approach to C–H activation. However, synthetic viability has been limited by the aryl substituents ability to stabilise the complex. The objective of this study was to identify suitable aryl substituents that could preserve the inherent oxidative capacity of the I(III) complex while ensuring reagent stability. Reliability in modeling ArIL2 complexes was assessed by benchmarking 19 methods and 6 basis set combinations against well-characterized triflate- and halogen-bound I(III) complexes. The best-performing method was then applied to evaluate the reaction energetics and subsequent reaction with XeF2  for the various complexes. The predicted complexes exhibited reaction energetics very similar to those of known I(III) species. This suggests that changing the aryl group has minimal impact on the complex’s reactivity and that the aryl moiety can be substituted without altering ligand coordination or the overall oxidative behavior.
