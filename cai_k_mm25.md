## Abstract
Poly(ionic liquids) (PolyILs), also referred to as polymerized ionic liquids, have attracted growing research interest as next-generation polymer electrolytes (PEs) for lithium and sodium batteries. Cationic PolyIL-based polymer-in-salt systems, in particular, have shown strong potential to overcome the persistent challenges of low ionic conductivity and limited metal-cation transference numbers in conventional polymer electrolytes.1,2
