## Abstract
Understanding and expanding the limits of element–element bonding remains a challenge in main-group chemistry. We present a comprehensive computational investigation of homonuclear and heteronuclear dimers across Groups 2 and 13-15, stabilized by the rigid naphthyridine diimine (NDI) framework that enforces proximity of the 2 elements. Molecular and electronic structure calculations were performed with DFT. Bonding interactions were analyzed using NBO, IBO, and QTAIM. Our results reveal diverse bonding motifs, ranging from electron-sharing σ bonds in lighter systems to highly polarized donor–acceptor interactions in heavier dimers. The stability of these dimers was further assessed through HOMO–LUMO gaps and dissociation energies. Importantly, non-nuclear attractors (NNAs) in the electron density were detected in Mg-Mg and Al-Al bonds. Together, these findings broaden the scope of main-group bonding, identify synthetically viable E-E linkages.
