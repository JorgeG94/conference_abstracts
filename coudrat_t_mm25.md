## Abstract
Drug discovery projects start with hit identification, where virtual screening (VS) by docking can be used to identify hit molecules from libraries. Recent billion-scale libraries, which provide new opportunities, are out of reach of VS due to compute costs. Our active learning (AL) approach docks a subset of the library to train a machine learning (ML) model surrogate and enable ultra-large library screens. Drug discovery projects progress to hit-to-lead, where we support decisions to synthesise the next molecules using free energy perturbation (FEP), a physics-based method to predict binding energies. Drug discovery projects then reach lead optimisation, where the critical properties of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) are precisely monitored using costly experimental assays. Our ML ADME prediction models guide the synthesis of molecules with promising profiles balancing both potency (FEP) and ADME properties.
