## Abstract
Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are promising platforms for data storage at the nanoscale. SMMs with strong coupling between metal centres are especially promising because of the suppression of magnetic relaxation via the ‘under barrier’ Raman process, which occurs at low temperatures (< c. 60 K) in other SMMs.
