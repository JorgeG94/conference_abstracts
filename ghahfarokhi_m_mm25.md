## Abstract
Water is known as a universal solvent but still there are anomalous physical and chemical properties that still hide many unravelled secrets. Unravelling these secrets requires accurate and efficient molecular simulation, to ensure predictions are accurate yet and fast enough to address many-body problems. Density functional theory (DFT) is the workhorse of modern quantum chemistry because it balances accuracy and efficiency in molecular simulations. I will discuss work on benchmarking basis sets and functionals to provide insight into optimal density functional approximations (DFAs) that balance accuracy in electronic densities and energies. According to our work, the most optimal αs are settled around 0.45 (Figure 2). Therefore, we recommend the use of a hybrid functional with 0.45 HF and 0.55 PBE as the most optimal functional for water molecules.
