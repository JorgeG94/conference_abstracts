## Abstract
Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) offers a solution for global warming by capturing CO2 from emissions and converting it into valuable fuels and chemicals. In this context, Faujasite (FAU) zeolites stand out for their high surface area and excellent CO2 adsorption, enabling low-energy uptake and catalysis. Computational studies employing Density Functional Theory (DFT) reveal that the chemical modification of FAU with single-atom transition metal catalysts (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) in the presence of extra-framework alkali cations (Li+, Na+, K+) significantly enhances CO2 activation and conversion efficiency. Extraframework cations boost performance by stabilizing SACs through charge distribution, improving efficiency. Ni@K-FAU emerges as the most efficient catalyst (Potential Determining Step (PDS) = 0.45 eV, with selective to CO2 to methanol conversion. This work sets a benchmark for tailoring zeolites toward specific products and unlocks new possibilities for CO2 catalysis.
