## Abstract
Since the abolishment of Amalgam, Dental Resin Composites (DRCs) have become the main restorative material of interest for the treatment of dental cavities. They provide substantial strength and stability and are aesthetically desirable, in that they can be modified to match the colour of a patient's teeth. However, their mechanical strength still pales in comparison to Amalgam and so there is significant motive to improve DRC performance.
