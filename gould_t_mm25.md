## Abstract
Our ability to simulate chemistry continues to rapidly progress, mostly
powered by density functional theory (DFT). We are now able to
simulate most organic reactions to high accuracy at moderate cost,
which has made simulation a vital part of the chemical and material
workflow for understanding chemistry and accelerating rational design.
However, many difficult problems remain difficult to simulate, especially
problems involving (transition) metal atoms that will drive future
technologies.
This talk will cover recent advances in the understanding and predictive
treatment of metal chemistry and related problems. It will first
demonstrate transferability[1] and paradigmatic failures of current state-
of-art DFT models. It will introduce a new method, DMet, that addresses
these failures. The resulting method enables high-quality DFT for
(nearly) everything.
