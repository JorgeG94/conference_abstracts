## Abstract
I will present our latest Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) approaches for electronic excitation energies, which are some of the currently most robust, as they provide a balanced description between local-valence and long-range excitations.(1) Examples include singlet-triplet gaps,(1) open-shell systems,(2) noncovalent interactions in excited states,(3-6) and the first-reported robust TD-DFT treatment of absorption in the important class of BODIPY dyes,(7) which are difficult to treat with standard methods.
