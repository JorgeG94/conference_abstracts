## Abstract
Aptamers are short DNA sequences that can recognize proteins with high specificity, making them ideal for biosensors. We present a multiscale computational approach to design aptamer-functionalized gold nanoparticles, combining structure prediction, docking, force field development, molecular dynamics, and binding free energy calculations. Using the Tr-WNV-37 aptamer for West Nile virus detection and gold nanoparticles of different size and shape, we show how surface immobilization and flexible linkers stabilize protein contacts while preserving aptamer structure. This framework offers molecular insights for designing sensitive and specific biofunctionalized surfaces, with applications in diagnostics and therapeutics.
