## Abstract
Amphotericin B (AmB) is a potent antifungal for invasive infections but causes severe toxicity due to low selectivity for fungal ergosterol over mammalian cholesterol and its tendency to aggregate. Maji et al. (Nature, 2023) developed AmB variant Am2-19 with reduced toxicity through selectively enhancing ergosterol sequestration kinetics. The role of aggregation in the mechanism is unclear. Our MD simulations show that Am2-19 aggregates much slower than AmB, forming less dense and more solvated aggregates, resulting in faster sterol contact formation than AmB. This is driven by the amide moiety, a key modification in Am2-19. Our findings suggest a mechanism whereby Am2-19 exhibits improved sterol binding kinetics due to the formation of looser aggregates, resulting in reduced kinetic trapping for cholesterol. Our findings add to our understanding of Am2-19’s reduced toxicity and may have implications for developing suitable formulations.
