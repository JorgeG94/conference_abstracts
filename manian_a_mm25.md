## Abstract
The propensity of a system to respond to magnetic fields (magnetosensitivity) underpins a wide range of applications. NV diamonds are well-known for their magnetosensitivity but are difficult to optimise and fabricate; magnetosensitive fluorescent proteins are an alternative. Among biological photoreceptors, cryptochrome and light-oxygen-voltage domains are the most well-studied optically-driven magnetosensitive proteins, broadly involving photoactivation, radical pair generation, hyperfine hopping, and recombination. Understanding these steps is vital for harnessing biomagnetoptical efficiencies. In this talk, I explore radical pair generation and the hyperfine interaction, highlighting efficient electron hopping and vibronic effects. I then couple these pathways to a weak magnetic field, to show how the photophysical pathways are affected. This work represents the first of many steps towards a complete quantum mechanical description of magnetosensing using protein-based systems.
