## Abstract
Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) are promising for catalytic applications due to their tunable core–surface structure and metal–ligand interface. Among these, Au25(SR)18 is extensively studied for its ease of synthesis and high stability. Advances in structural characterisation and synthesis have linked its atomic structure to catalytic activity in reactions such as the oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by hydrogen peroxide and the chemical transformation of terminal alkynes. Post-synthetic ligand exchange, particularly replacing thiolate ligands with alkynyl or water-soluble ones, enables further modification of the clusters. This work re-examines the literature mechanism of ligand exchange and catalysis of Au25 nanoclusters, focusing on the core–staple motifs, local environment and reaction conditions. Understanding these mechanistic aspects from quantum mechanical methods will enable design of improved catalysts and ligand exchange strategies.
