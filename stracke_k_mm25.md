## Abstract
Enhanced sampling methods in molecular dynamics simulations often struggle to handle interdependent or discontinuous collective variables. Therefore, many complex systems remain a challenge to simulate. We introduce bias deletion metadynamics, a technique that conditionally deletes biases to enable repeated exploration of transition pathways and systematic refinement of the sampled configuration space. We benchmark bias deletion metadynamics, demonstrating its ability to handle recurrent rotational motion where conventional metadynamics can fail. We further show its power by resolving the distinct phases of CAU-13 using only a volume bias, a known challenge for other methods. Finally, by applying this approach to a series of isoreticular metal-organic frameworks (MIL-53(Al), NU-2002, MIL-cub, and NU-2000), we uncover the intricate coupling between linker rotation and framework volume, revealing how linker dimensionality dictates volume-specific rotational preferences.
