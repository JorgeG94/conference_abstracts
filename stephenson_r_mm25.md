## Abstract
A novel treatment has been developed to conserve marble cultural heritage objects which involves the in-situ reaction between the calcite surface and an aqueous phosphate solution to form a passivating calcium phosphate (CaP) mineral layer. Recently, the addition of small amounts of organic solvent to the initial reagent solution has been found to drastically improve the efficacy of the coating formed. However, the reason for why this change occurs is still unknown. Through molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations, our work better elucidates the role of the organic solvents in the synthesis of the CaP coating by delving into the impact on a molecular scale. Presently, we are investigating the effect of organic solvents on calcium phosphate ion pairing to better understand the impact of solvents on this behaviour. Overall, these computational insights will aid in developing more effective conservation strategies for marble cultural heritage objects.
