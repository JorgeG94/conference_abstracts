## Abstract
Adhesion of polymeric coatings on diverse substrates governs material durability but remains difficult to rationalize due to complex interplays between interfacial chemistry, surface structure, and processing. Conventional adhesion tests yield sparse, heterogeneous, and often semi-quantitative data, limiting predictive insight across coating systems. This study combines machine learning (ML)-driven modelling with molecular representation to predict and interpret coating adhesion, surveying recent ML applications across paints, adhesives, and composites. Preliminary results show that interpretable ML can yield robust predictions from small datasets, highlighting coating chemistry and surface treatment as key factors. Ongoing work integrates molecular descriptors to link physicochemical and structural features with interfacial adhesion, enabling interpretable, data-driven design of sustainable and durable coating systems.
