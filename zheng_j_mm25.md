## Abstract
Liquid metals (LMs) are promising catalysts that develop self-limiting oxide layers influencing their performance, though atomic-scale mechanisms remain unclear. We used ab initio molecular dynamics to investigate surface oxidation of Ga, EGaIn, and SnIn. Through atomic distribution and radial distribution function analysis, we elucidated distinct oxide formation characteristics. O2 molecules initially orient parallel to LM surfaces, then undergo rapid dissociation preferentially over base metals rather than dopants. Ga forms a self-limiting 2D oxide network with O confined to the uppermost layer. EGaIn shows preferential Ga oxidation with In surface segregation. SnIn forms a thin oxide extending into bulk, predominantly In oxide. These findings provide key insights for understanding LM catalysis and catalyst design.
