## Abstract
Supercomputers are getting really powerful. The confluence of heterogeneous high-performance hardware like GPUs, high-performance networking and better programming models have ushered in the era of extreme-scale computing in science. While these new technologies certainly have great potential to accelerate scientific discovery, the rapid pace of change has also made it difficult to get the most out of these new architectures without specialist knowledge.
