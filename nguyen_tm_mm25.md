## Abstract
The discovery of superionic solid-state electrolytes for cation batteries is currently limited by the range of materials available in online materials databases. Here we introduce a physics-informed hierarchical generative framework that leverages symmetry-aware crystallographic principles to systematically explore molecular configurations, lattice parameters, and bonding environments. We propose symmetry-aware hierarchical architecture for flow-based traversal with density (SHAFT-density) that ensures efficient exploration of the material search space, prioritizing low formation energy, molecular packing optimized for stability and conductivity, and enhanced electrochemical properties. We discovered new binary and ternary metastable phases, of which we find highly conductive LiBr, LiCl, Li2IBr, and Li3CBr2. These materials can either function as solid-state electrolyte materials or be part of solid-state electrolyte mixtures.
