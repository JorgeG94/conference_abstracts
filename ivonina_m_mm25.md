## Abstract

Antiviral medicine has evolved with RNA-targeting therapies, but the
complex RNA dynamics make computational modelling challenging
compared to proteins, conventional drug targets. Structured RNA
elements, such as pseudoknots, are crucial for viral replication and
present promising drug targets. The SARS-CoV-2 genome contains a
pseudoknot that regulates –1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (–1
PRF), essential for viral protein synthesis. We used Molecular Dynamics
simulations to explore its conformational dynamics and examined
how Merafloxacin, a known –1 PRF inhibitor, interacts with the pseudo
knot compared to inactive analogues. The machine-learning-based
approach called Spectral Maps determined conformations of pseudoknot
upon drug binding. Through-Space/Through-Bond energy decomposition
analysis was implemented to dissect RNA–ligand binding energetics.
This integrated approach provides molecular insight into how small
molecules modulate structured RNA motifs, guiding RNA-targeted drug
discovery.
