## Abstract
Catalytic hydrogenolysis is a promising technique that can break the C-C bond in polyolefins such as polyethylene (PE) to produce small molecules that could be used as fuels. Recently, Ru based catalysts have been identified as promising candidates for the depolymerization of PE. Various factors can affect the reactivity and selectivity of these catalysts, such as the presence of atomic hydrogens on the catalyst surface as well as the charge transfer occurring at the surface. We employed density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the effect of the adsorbed atomic hydrogens and charge transfer involving surface Ru species on the cleavage of C-C bond in polyethylene using butane as a proxy. Our study aims to provide valuable insights for the development of novel and efficient catalytic systems for the conversion of waste plastic items into useful products.
