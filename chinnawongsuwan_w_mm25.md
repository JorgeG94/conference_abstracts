## Abstract
The ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) is a 2.3 MDa calcium release channel essential for skeletal muscle contraction. Despite being a hotspot for disease-causing variants, many remain classified as variants of uncertain significance. We present the first full-length human RyR1 structure, built by multi-template homology modelling with cryo-EM–guided tetramer assembly, capturing detailed residue environments across the channel. From this model we derived descriptors –evolutionary conservation, physicochemical change, pocket geometry, interaction networks, energetic (de)stabilisation, and disorder propensity, to train a structure-aware AI classifier for RyR1 variant pathogenicity. The model outperforms widely used predictors (MCC 0.84) and provides residue-level mechanistic insight. This integrative platform bridges structural biology and machine learning, enabling confident reclassification of uncertain variants and guiding precise diagnostics and future therapies for congenital myopathies.
