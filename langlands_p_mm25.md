## Abstract
The phrase ‘error cancellation’ is well known to the computational quantum chemistry community. The most common cancellation is between single point energy errors of reactants and products in the calculation of reaction energies. This allows for more modest approximations to be employed, reducing the computational resources required. In turn, this has garnered attention in the community, prompting the search for other forms of error cancellation that could prove just as beneficial.
