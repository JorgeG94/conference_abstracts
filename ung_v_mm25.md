## Abstract
Enzyme catalysis is often described by quantum mechanics, yet structural ensemble studies show it also relies on precise reactant positioning – features accessible to molecular mechanics (MM). To test whether MM-based simulations can inform on bond formation and hydrolysis, we investigated the bacterial adhesion protein Cpe0147, which autocatalytically forms a Thr–Gln ester crosslink. Using enhanced molecular dynamics, and mutagenesis experiments, we assessed how conformational ensembles of catalytic residues relate to crosslinking efficiency. Simulations uncovered positioning of key residues that facilitate bond formation, and revealed that crosslink resilience arises from conformational barriers that restrict hydrolysis-promoting states. These results highlight how MM-based simulations can help explain catalytic strategies typically attributed to quantum chemistry, while illustrating convergent evolution of a robust protein crosslink.
