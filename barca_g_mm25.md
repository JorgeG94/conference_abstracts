## Abstract 
Addressing many of today’s most pressing technological and scientific
challenges—from new therapeutics and biotechnologies to greener
chemical processes—requires fast, chemically accurate modelling,
either for high-throughput exploration of vast small-molecule spaces or
for large-scale atomistic simulations of complex systems. Yet current
methods sit at two extremes: high-fidelity quantum-chemical approaches
that are too slow and costly for large systems or long timescales, and
fast but low-fidelity classical or heuristic models that lack essential
quantum-mechanical detail, leaving discovery heavily dependent on
physical experiments that are time-consuming, expensive, and
intrinsically limited in the chemistries and conditions they can probe.
In response, we present a digital chemistry framework that couples
many-GPU high-performance computing, computational quantum
chemistry, and machine learning to deliver quantum-level accuracy at
both high throughput and large atomistic scale. By combining novel
algorithms, GPU-native software optimizations, and hybrid machinelearning–quantum approaches, we overcome the steep computational
barriers that have historically confined accurate quantum chemistry to
small systems. Recognized with the 2024 Gordon Bell Prize, our
framework enables exascale simulations of quantum-mechanical
systems over 1000× larger than previous state of the art, with >1000×
speedups in time-to-solution.
By complementing these exascale quantum chemistry capabilities with
agentic AI workflows acting as an “AI copilot,” and machine-learning
models trained on quantum-accurate data, we streamline end-to-end
chemical simulation and design. These intelligent, closed-loop workflows
reduce reliance on laboratory experiments, providing automatable, costeffective, and adaptive solution for investigating complex molecular
phenomena. The result is a powerful platform that accelerates chemical
discovery, enhances molecular design, and expands the scope of in
silico research across chemistry, biology, and related fields.
