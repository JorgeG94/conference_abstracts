## Abstract 

Since the foundational work of Kohn and Hohenberg in 1960s, Density
Functional Theory (DFT) has become a leading approach to solve the
Schrödinger’s wave equation for molecular systems. The first
Hohenberg-Kohn theorem in DFT established the one-to-one
correspondence between electron density and electronic energy,
connected via an unknown external potential. The quest for this potential
has led to the development of many DFT functionals whose accuracy
can rival “gold standard” methods in computational chemistry.
Performance of DFT functionals depends on the nature of the XC
potential that captures unknown terms in DFT. We overcame the
problem of designing an accurate exchange-correlation functional by
teaching physics to a machine-learning code. We have achieved an ML
code with accuracy of below 1 kcal/mol outperforming best DFT
functionals. In this talk I will showcase why the developed physics-driven
approach can be heralded as a revolution in DFT development.
