## Abstract
High entropy oxides (HEOs) are emerging as promising catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because of their tunable compositions and resource efficiency. We synthesised a library of La(RuwNixMnyFez)O3 perovskites by continuous hydrothermal flow co-precipitation and screened them for OER activity, finding most candidates to be phase-pure orthorhombic LaFeO3-type structures with competitive performance and reduced ruthenium content. Guided by machine learning, we synthesised a new series of HEOs that showed enhanced OER activity and stability, validating the effectiveness of ML in catalyst optimisation and accelerated materials discovery.
