## Abstract
Our society is heavily reliant on electronic devices to power everyday items, such as mobile phones and computers, as well as being essential for industrial processes and medicine. These devices consume significant amounts of energy and are reaching their limits. Hence, new materials are needed to provide low power electronics. In this talk I will discuss examples where we use density functional theory calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to develop nanomaterials for components in electronic devices and energy storage systems. I will focus on the outcomes of the following projects: 1) Defective SiC nanotubes as anode materials for alkali metal ion batteries [1,2]; 2) Piezoelectric response of bilayer and heterobilayer group-IV monochalcogenides under applied external strain [3].
