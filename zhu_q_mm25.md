## Abstract
Amyloid beta (A$\beta$), a hallmark protein of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), aggregates into plaques strongly linked to cognitive decline and neuronal death. Reducing its aggregation propensity represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Among proposed inhibitors, peptides show notable potential due to their specificity and biocompatibility. Here, we used temperature-replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations to explore conformational landscapes induced by its N-terminal mutations and chirality inversion. Sampling convergence was achieved within 0.8-1.2 $\mu$s per replica, as assessed by radius of gyration and secondary structure evolution. Analyses of pairwise interactions and secondary structure populations revealed that N-terminal modulation influences are not localized. Residue-level contributions were found to be environment-dependent. These insights advance understanding of site-specific mutations and chirality effects, providing guidance for peptide-based AD therapies.
