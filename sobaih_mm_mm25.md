## Abstract
Glycosylation profoundly influences protein stability and function. Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) circulate as a ternary complex with IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) and the acid-labile subunit (ALS), extending IGF half-life and receptor regulation. To clarify the structural roles of ALS glycans, we performed extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (30 μs total; 10 glycan-removal variants × 3 replicates × 1 μs). Complete glycan removal significantly destabilized ALS’s characteristic umbrella-shaped architecture, whereas individual glycan deletions induced localized flexibility. DSSP, residue contact maps, and MM/GBSA binding free-energy analyses identified glycans Asn-96, Asn-515, and Asn-580 as critical stabilizers, providing mechanistic insights for experimental validation.
