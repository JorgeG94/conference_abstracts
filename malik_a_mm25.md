## Abstract
It’s established that structure is more conserved than sequence, a fact rooted in the constraints of 3D geometry. This is why structural comparisons often succeed in recovering deeper signals where sequence alignments fail. This begs a powerful question: if moving from a 1D sequence to 3D geometry reveals so much more evolutionary history, what if we increased the dimensionality even further? Could analyzing proteins in hundreds of dimensions uncover deeper-resolved signals invisible even in 3D? This is where protein language models that encode the complex interplay of sequence, structure, and function into rich, high-dimensional embeddings become helpful. Our method, Structome-DeepRoots, uses these powerful representations to move beyond conventional 3D analysis, tapping into this space to reconstruct evolutionary history with greater resolution than ever before. In this talk, I will show how it recovers known splits on curated data and outperforms our baseline method, Structome-TM.
