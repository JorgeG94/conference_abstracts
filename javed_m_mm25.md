## Abstract
2D Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) monolayer hybrid perovskites (R-NH3)2An-1BnX3n+1 with tailorable photovoltaic features of low toxicity, reduced dimensionality, and improved stability hold promise to overcome the main constraints of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this study, we put 2%, 4%, 6%, and 8% biaxial strains on 2D monolayers of phenyl-ammonium tin iodide (PH2SnI4) perovskites. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to study the structural distortion, octahedral tilting, band gap tuning, Bader charge analysis, and mechanical stability of the resulting configurations. Band gaps under the effects of compressive strain (Eg1), zero strain (Eg2), and tensile strain (Eg3) follow a decreasing order of Eg1(1.262 eV) < Eg2(1.329 eV) < Eg3(1.331 eV) for 6%-strain. The absence of trap states in energy band gaps and dominant cation and anion contributions at conduction and valence band edges supports the defect tolerance.
