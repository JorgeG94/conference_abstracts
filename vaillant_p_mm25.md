## Abstract
Computational and experimental investigations into the structural and atomic behaviours within various liquid metal systems revealed that liquid metal systems were more structured than previously thought. Atomic force microscopy was used to investigate the liquid metal near the oxide interfacial region, with gallium, EGaIn and Galinstan exhibiting different levels of complexity in the force curves, indicating some structuring around the oxide. Neutron scattering techniques highlighted that the bulk also behaves in a similar fashion, with profiles exhibiting differences between various systems. Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics simulations highlighted that the solute atoms in the gallium alloys forming smaller aggregates or long-range chain-like structures. While the solute atoms formed these structures, the gallium acted like a solvent. The simulation further revealed that these structures and behaviours occurred in the bulk and oxide interfacial region, supporting the experimental studies.
