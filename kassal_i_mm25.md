## Abstract 
Quantum-chemical calculations scale poorly with molecule size due to
the complexity of simulating electronic and nuclear motion. Quantum
computers could solve this problem by enabling exponentially faster
simulations. Our recent results bring forward useful quantum computing
for chemistry through orders-of-magnitude reductions in required
quantum resources. We developed an approach for performing fully non-
adiabatic simulations of chemical dynamics using trapped-ion quantum
computers by mapping nuclear motion onto the motion of the trapped
ions. Our experimental demonstrations have led to the first simulations
of chemical reactions on a quantum computer, the best quantum-
computer simulation of spectroscopy, and the first direct observation of
geometric-phase interference in dynamics around a conical intersection.
These demonstrations pave the way for near-term applications of
existing quantum technology in computational chemistry.
