## Abstract
Gold-based nanoglasses, combining unique structure and plasmonic properties, find applications in catalysis, implants, and sensors. This study employs molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the glass-forming ability (GFA) of Au–Cu–Ag ternary and Au–Cu/Au–Ag binary metallic nanoparticles under various quench rates. We evaluate key local structural descriptors—bond-orientational order, Voronoi statistics, coordination number, etc.—separately for core and surface atoms to capture geometry-dependent ordering. We quantify GFA from the post-quench crystalline fraction and the abundance of perfect and distorted icosahedral motifs, which are indicative of vitrification. Cu-rich nanoparticles display the highest GFA, maintaining a negligible crystalline fraction across various quench-rates and exhibiting elevated icosahedral content, whereas Ag-containing alloys show a lower GFA.
