## Abstract
We designed a multi-epitope vaccine against Pseudomonas aeruginosa using reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. From 5563 proteins, we screened for non-homology, stability, non-allergenicity, adhesion, and immunogenicity using VaxElan, identifying coat protein A of bacteriophage Pf1, alkaline phosphatase L, and a secreted protein. SignalP 5.0 predicted secretory signals; Expasy assessed physicochemical properties. B-cell, CTL, and HTL epitopes were predicted using ABCpred, NetCTL 1.2, and NetMHCIIpan 4.0, and evaluated for antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity. Selected epitopes were docked with TLR2 and TLR4 using Glide. Six vaccine constructs (DV1–DV6) with adjuvants were modeled using Robetta and assessed for stability. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations highlighted DV5 as the most stable and promising construct. These findings suggest our multi-epitope vaccine has strong potential against P. aeruginosa infections.
