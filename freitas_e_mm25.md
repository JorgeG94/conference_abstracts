## Abstract 

Innovative solutions to mitigate corrosion are constantly being proposed,
but using small organic molecules as inhibitors remains one of the most
efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective strategies. Despite global efforts
to develop new inhibitors, a key question persists: What molecular
properties define an effective inhibitor? Molecular modeling helps
answer this by exploring nanoscale interfaces. Most theoretical studies
either follow standard procedures or use oversimplified models. To
address this, we present a novel approach modeling the inhibitor-metal-
solvent interface accurately. Using NEGF, we apply potential to
electrodes, while water is treated via QM/MM. All is implemented in the
efficient SIESTA code. We showcase this by studying 2-
mercaptobenzoimidazole on Cu slabs, revealing physical blocking of the
surface and charge redistribution. Our method enables realistic
electrochemical interface modeling, advancing corrosion simulation
beyond standard DFT.
