## Abstract
Thermally activated reactions of gas phase molecules with and on molecular solids are widespread, occurring in applications from heterogeneous catalysis to materials weathering.  Despite the ubiquity of such reactions, methods to model these systems using reliable potential energy surfaces derived from quantum chemistry calculations are not well developed.  In this work we develop a new methodology designed to simulate such systems.  The underlying representation of the potential is a recently-developed neural network formalism that has the fundamental isotropies of atomic configurations built in. Here I discuss using this approach to model the reaction of hyperthermal hydrogen atoms with the molecules of carbon monoxide ices at low temperatures, which is thought to be an important route for the formation of formaldehyde in interstellar space.
