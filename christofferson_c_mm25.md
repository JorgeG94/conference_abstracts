## Abstract 

Nanomaterials have the ability to revolutionize the development of novel
therapies, with applications ranging from drug delivery and diagnostics
to controlling specific biological process. Current research is aimed at
specific tasks such as enhancing cellular uptake of a material whilst
keeping functionality. However, the specific interactions that govern
nanomaterial behaviour in biological systems, in particular cellular
membranes, remain difficult to elucidate due to the complex dynamic
nature of the lipid bilayer environment. Here, we use a combination of
atomic force microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to
elucidate the precise mechanisms by which various ligand capped 5 nm
gold nanoparticles (AuNP) interact with supported lipid bilayers of pure
fluid phospholipids. When the ligand capping agent is altered,
differences in adsorption and bilayer disruption as a function of capping
agent size and functional group are observed. Primarily, smaller ligands
can facilitate AuNP interaction with the bilayer, where as larger sized
ligands may shield this interaction leading to interfacial interaction or
adsorption inhibition. These results reveal how functionalized AuNPs
interact with differing biological membranes, with mechanisms that could
also have cooperative membrane effects with other molecules.
