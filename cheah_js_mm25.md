## Abstract
The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is a ligand gated ion channel that has been suggested to play a key role in inflammation. Cholesterol is believed to affect P2X7R activity, although it is unclear whether this is direct or indirect. Furthermore, it is known that palmitoylation – where a fatty acid is covalently attached to the protein – can affect the receptor’s sensitivity to cholesterol. Coarse-grained simulations were performed to investigate the feasibility of cholesterol binding to the P2X7R. The open and closed states of the receptor with or without palmitoylation were simulated for 30μs in triplicate in a 20% CHOL and 80% POPC membrane.
