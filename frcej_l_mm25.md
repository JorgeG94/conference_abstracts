## Abstract
The molecular mechanisms by which cryoprotective agents (CPAs) such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) interact with cell membranes remain poorly understood. Molecular dynamics simulations of DOPC-cholesterol (CHOL) bilayers were performed at varying DMSO concentrations and hydration levels. CHOL condensed the bilayers, reducing the area per lipid (APL) with increasing CHOL content. Under full hydration, APLs were largely unaffected by dilute DMSO, while under dehydration (DH) CHOL counteracted DMSO-induced expansion. The APL increase observed for dehydrated pure DOPC bilayers was reduced in 2DOPC:1CHOL systems and eliminated in 1DOPC:1CHOL. DMSO penetration was enhanced at high concentrations for the 1DOPC:1CHOL bilayer in comparison to 2DOPC:1CHOL despite increased condensation. Overall, CHOL mitigates the structural effects of DMSO without hindering its penetration, highlighting its modulatory role in DOPC bilayers under cryoprotective conditions.
