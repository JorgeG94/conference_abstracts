## Abstract
Excimers (excited dimers of identical monomers) and exciplexes (excited complexes of distinct monomers) are defined as being more strongly bound in their electronically excited state compared to the ground state. They are bound by non-covalent interactions (NCIs) including electrostatics, charge transfer, London dispersion, and excitonic splitting (excimers only). It is not yet clear whether time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) methods are able to adequately describe excimer and exciplex binding. We present a benchmarking set of excimers and exciplexes which includes localised, charge-transfer, and Rydberg excitations. [1,2] We test various TD-DFT methods for their ability to describe excimer and exciplex binding compared to accurate coupled-cluster reference data. This work reveals surprising challenges for modelling excited-state NCIs in even seemingly simple systems.
