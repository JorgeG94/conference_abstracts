## Abstract
Mixing a co-solvent into salt-concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes reduces viscosity while preserving interfacial chemistry needed for stable lithium metal cycling. We used molecular dynamics to study 1:1 salt-to-IL electrolytes with 20 wt% additives: DME (strong), MDFSA (weak), and TFTFE (non-coordinating). In bulk, DME and MDFSA coordinate to Li, reduce Li–anion aggregation, and enhance mobility; DME shows the largest diffusion gain. TFTFE does not coordinate with Li but forms a subphase that improves transport. Diffusivity order: DME > TFTFE > MDFSA > dry IL. At Au(111) interfaces, DME enriches cations and lowers Li and FSI, while MDFSA and TFTFE resemble dry IL. Notably, TFTFE, though absent at the interface, preserves IL-like chemistry even at 40 mol% salt, enabling reduced salt with stable interfaces and enhanced transport. This strategy balances performance, stability, and cost, advancing IL electrolytes for lithium batteries while providing insight into cosolvent effects.
