## Abstract
Corrosion prevention using organic corrosion inhibitors (CI) is an efficient, green, and cost-effective method. Understanding of inhibitor adsorption and film stability in corrosive medium aids in the design of novel CI. Theoretical studies based on density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the efficacy of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole (MBI) as anti-corrosive agent for Cu have been reported in vacuum conditions. However, solvent molecules can influence charge redistribution at the inhibitor-adsorbate interface, which is a dynamic process that requires ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We tackle precisely that problem by applying AIMD to investigate MBI adsorption at oxidized Cu under the solvent effects. Our results showed that solvent stabilizes MBI@N-H bond that keeps breaking and forming during simulations performed in a vacuum, and MBI layer protects the oxide surface from solvent, preventing its dissolution.
