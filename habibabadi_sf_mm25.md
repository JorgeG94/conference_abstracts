## Abstract
This research explores ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as innovative alternatives to traditional solvents for protein handling and preservation. Protic ILs can promote amphiphile self-assembly, while DESs offer low cost, environmental benefits, and food-grade compatibility. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we study IL–water and DES–water systems to reveal solvation processes and their effects on proteins. Key questions include which solvent components dominate solvation and how biomolecules respond to solvent behaviour. The outcomes have broad implications, from improving poorly soluble pharmaceutical proteins to advancing cryopreservation. Comparisons with experiments, such as small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), validate the findings and highlight the potential of ILs and DESs to transform biotechnology and pharmaceutical applications.
