## Abstract 
Understanding the fundamental chemistry and physics at the calcite-
water interface is of high interest due to its involvement in many
interdisciplinary areas, including biomineralization, evolution of life and
climate, and CO2 sequestration. Here, the {10-14} facet is the most
extensively studied due to its high stability and frequent occurrence.
While its atomic structure is widely accepted and involves little if any
reconstruction, claims of reconstruction have emerged over the past
three decades, based on experimental and theoretical studies. Using
Density Functional Theory lattice dynamics and molecular dynamics we
identified the conditions that enable such reconstruction, explained why
it arises in specific cases, and described its underlying mechanism in
vacuum and in water.
