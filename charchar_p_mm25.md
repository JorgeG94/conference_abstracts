## Abstract
Thiolate-protected nanoclusters are remarkable catalytic and theranostic materials. Their rational design requires understanding the link between structure and physicochemical properties. Organic ligands provide stability and recognition, while the internal gold–sulphur framework yields unique molecular behaviours such as discrete energy levels, luminescence, magnetism, and catalytic activity. Among these nanoclusters, Au25(SR)18 is the prototypical and most heavily researched, featuring pyritohedral (Th) pseudo-symmetry that organises gold/sulphur atoms and dictates ligand arrangements. This symmetry must be explicitly considered when statistically analysing structural information, as chemically equivalent motifs profoundly impact interpretation. In this talk, I share practical insights and examples from my research, ranging from ligand dynamics and pKa assignment to active site occupancy and molecular coordinate projection, illustrating why respecting complex symmetry is essential.
