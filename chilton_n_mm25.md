## Abstract 

Vibronic coupling is a central component of energy transfer processes,
and is a fundamental mechanism in dictating spin lifetimes in solid
materials. However, it is a difficult effect to directly observe. We have
been using far infrared magnetospectroscopy (FIRMS) to probe vibronic
coupling in magnetic molecules, and we have developed quantum
chemical methods to assign the transitions. Here we show some of the
first examples of single-crystal FIRMS that allow us to probe the
anisotropy of vibronic coupling, as well as proving the origin of the
vibronic transitions. These allow us to prove that most transitions are
intra-Kramers in origin, where the vibronic transition involves a low-
energy EPR-like transition within the ground Kramers doublet and
simultaneous excitation of a high-energy optical phonon mode.
