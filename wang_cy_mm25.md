## Abstract
Carbon cluster anions (Cn−) are of significant interest as potential carriers of astronomical absorption features, notably the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs). We employed quantum-chemical methods to investigate the structural and energetic properties of both linear and cyclic Cn− species. Relative stabilities and electron affinities were systematically evaluated using multiple computational approaches, thereby establishing a reliable energetic profile to assist spectroscopic studies. Calculations to interpret available experimental spectra were also conducted, and this presentation will reveal both the potential advantages and the challenges of the selected methods for calculating spectra of these systems.
