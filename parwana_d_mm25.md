## Abstract
Identifying allosteric residues and mapping their communication pathways is a key challenge in drug design. We address this by extending the α-carbon-based elastic network model (ENM) to pinpoint residues that control global dynamics. Our method introduces local perturbations by incorporating additional nodes into the ENM to simulate the local crowding effect of ligand binding. By comparing mean-square fluctuation (MSF) profiles between perturbed and unperturbed states, we identify residues whose influence propagates throughout the protein. Application to proteins with known drug-binding sites confirms that perturbing allosteric residues strongly modulates soft-mode (global) motions. Our approach successfully identifies allosteric hotspots and reveals their dynamic links to the active site. This structural mapping of fluctuation changes uncovers the "communication pathways" that dynamically connect these functionally relevant regions.
