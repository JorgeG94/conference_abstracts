## Abstract
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising as antibiotic alternatives, biomaterials, and beyond. Among chemical modifications to enhance AMP performance, C-terminal amidation is a simple yet powerful strategy that stabilizes peptide structure, strengthens membrane interactions, and improves protease resistance, making it widely adopted in synthesis. However, most existing AMP prediction models overlook amidated peptides, leading to reduced accuracy in practical applications.
