## Abstract
Ions in condensed phases generate substantial local electric fields that can alter the structure of the bulk environment. However, counterions will act and arrange themselves to negate this field, leading to a phenomenon known as electrostatic screening. Over the last decade, experimental measurements of electrostatic screening lengths in concentrated electrolytes have far exceeded theoretical predictions by orders of magnitude. Leading to a paradigm in which such screening lengths are referred to as “anomalous” underscreening, while others – predominantly those predicted by theory and molecular simulation – are referred to as “normal underscreening”. No satisfactory explanation of the difference between the two has been reached. To resolve this, a multimodal screening length analysis of polarisable molecular dynamics simulations is conducted using Prony’s method for a series of aqueous alkali chloride electrolytes.
