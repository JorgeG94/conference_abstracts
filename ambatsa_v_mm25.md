## Abstract
Sustainable valorisation of CO2 into cyclic carbonates remains limited by the design of efficient catalysts. Cavitand-based polyphenols present a unique framework for the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides via cooperative hydrogen bonding interactions. Their ability to operate under relatively mild conditions, high turnover numbers, and robustness make them attractive for sustainable catalysis. However, subtle differences in the cavitand structures largely impact their catalytic performance. This can be justified by evaluating conformational dynamics of alkyl-substituted cavitand scaffolds in solution. In this study, I shall employ molecular dynamics coupled with enhanced sampling techniques to map the conformational free energy landscape of resorcin[4]arene and pyrogallol[4]arene. Furthermore, I shall apply potential of mean force (PMF) calculations to quantify relative free energies and identify dominant conformers linked to enhanced catalytic performance.
