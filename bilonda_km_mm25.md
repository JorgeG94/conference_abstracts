## Abstract
Squalene (C30H50) is a polyunsaturated hydrocarbon synthesized in human cells, known for its antioxidant, anti-senescence, emollient, moisturizing, and immune-supporting functions. It contains six (all-E)-configured double bonds and serves as a key substrate for Squalene Monooxygenase in cholesterol biosynthesis [1]. In this study, a comprehensive conformational analysis of squalene was conducted using Density Functional Theory (DFT) with B3LYP, M06-2X, and TPSSH functionals and the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set. Calculations were performed in vacuo and in solvents of varying polarity. Intramolecular H...H interactions, vibrational frequencies, zero-point energies, dipole moments, HOMO-LUMO gaps, and solvent effects were evaluated to understand squalene’s electronic and structural behaviour. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of squalene’s physicochemical properties and its potential applications in biomedical and pharmaceutical contexts.
