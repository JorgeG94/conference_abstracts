## Abstract
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations typically fix the number of particles, limiting their ability to model systems with changing composition—such as nucleation and crystal growth in solutions. To compute time-independent growth rates, constant chemical potential MD is needed. While grand canonical methods allow particle exchange, they are inefficient in condensed phases due to low acceptance rates. Adaptive resolution schemes address this but require complex implementations. This work introduces a simpler method using harmonic volumetric restraints to regulate osmotic pressure, serving as a proxy for chemical potential. The approach reproduces ideal gas and solution behavior and, using the mW water model, yields constant ice growth rates in electrolyte solutions—unlike standard MD.
