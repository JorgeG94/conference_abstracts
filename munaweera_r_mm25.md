## Abstract
Polymer informatics is advancing rapidly, but its progress is hindered by scarce and inconsistent experimental datasets. High-throughput molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide a pathway to overcome these challenges by producing large, standardized datasets with atomistic resolution. Such datasets minimize variability from synthesis or measurement and allow systematic exploration of structure–property relationships. In this work, we introduce a workflow that integrates MD with polymer informatics, using poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)(PNIPAM) as a model system. Accurate parameter sets reproduced PNIPAM’s thermoresponsive behavior, while extensive MD runs generated datasets tailored for machine learning applications. We further extracted key descriptors from MD trajectories that link molecular-level features to macroscopic behavior. This study highlights how MD-driven datasets can bridge gaps in experimental data and accelerate the development of predictive tools in polymer informatics.
