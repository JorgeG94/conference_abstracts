## Abstract
Machine learning (ML) is the primary tool to accurately forecast carbon-based electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLC) capacitance and life cycle, allowing material screening and maintenance planning with optimizing cost and time efficiency. Lately, uncertainty quantification and explainability consistently turn “black box” predictions into structure–property insights. The central theme has shifted from prediction to inverse design, where models propose carbon architecture and surface chemistries that meet pre-specified properties. This presentation briefs the ML workflow, popular algorithms, opportunities and challenges in EDLCs research. We aimed to outline a closed-loop workflow that connects high-throughput simulations, ML-guided design and experimentation to accelerate material design for EDLCs. We also provide an in-depth review of several recently published ML-driven projects, highlighting their remarks, accuracy and proposing the general perspective of future directions.
