## Abstract
Global plastic waste exceeds 400 metric tons annually and may reach 1.1 billion tons by 2050, yet less than 10% is recycled. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), comprising ~12% of plastics, persists for decades, driving interest in sustainable upcycling strategies. Photoreforming has emerged as a promising route to convert PET waste into fuels and value-added products. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a low-cost, non-toxic photocatalyst, has been shown to drive the photoreforming of ethylene glycol (EG), a PET degradation product, though its mechanism remains unclear.
