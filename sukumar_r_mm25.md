## Abstract
The demand for sustainable energy storage has driven interest in next-generation secondary batteries using nitroxide radicals (TEMPO) for their rapid redox kinetics and high theoretical capacity. In aqueous electrolytes, the TEMPO radical exhibits a redox potential of approximately 1.3 V. Recently, the emergence of ionic liquids has been shown to stabilise both the TEMPO radical and its redox states, while also enhancing the redox potential. Since electrochemical properties are highly influenced by structural variations, zwitterionic-based nitroxide radicals and nitroxide radicals with positively charged functional groups have been studied along with the ionic liquids by combining molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculations. The newly designed nitroxide radicals in the presence of ionic liquids exhibit an oxidation potential above 1.0 eV, significantly higher than literature values (~0.7 eV), demonstrating their potential for the flexible design of secondary batteries.
