## Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric catalysis plays a critical role in modern organic synthesis by enabling the selective formation of enantioenriched molecules. In this context, the Hyland group have employed sulfamidate imines as heteroatom-rich prochiral pronucleophiles in diverse asymmetric reactions. In this work, sulfamidate imines are used in palladium-catalysed homoallenylation with 1,3-enynes, generating both point and axial chirality. While experimentally valuable, the mechanistic origins of its selectivity remain unclear. Using density functional theory, we show that the nucleophilic attack step is stereochemistry-determining, with transition-state conformations controlling diastereo- and enantioselectivity. Analysis of pathway energies identifies preferred orientations consistent with experiment, clarifying the mechanism and providing a framework for rational ligand and substrate design in asymmetric palladium catalysis.
