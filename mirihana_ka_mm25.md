## Abstract
Nanomaterials are increasingly applied in biomedicine, offering solutions where conventional methods fall short. At the core is the nano–bio interface, enabling advances in drug delivery, nanomedicine, diagnostics, imaging, and antimicrobial therapies. Lipid-Coated Hybrid Nanoparticles (LCHNPs) are a key development, combining an inorganic core with a lipid shell that improves biocompatibility, loading, and targeting while mimicking natural membranes. Phospholipids self-assemble or attach to nanoparticle surfaces, forming lipid coronas that control uptake, adhesion, and fusion, even with simple mixtures. However, their precise arrangement remains unclear. We used molecular dynamics simulations to examine corona formation of seven lipid types on gold nanoparticles, revealing how composition shape's structure and function. These insights advance the design of biomimetic nanocarriers for targeted delivery and antimicrobial applications.
