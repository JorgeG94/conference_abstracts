## Abstract
Amyloid nanonets formed by self-assembling β-sheet peptides have emerged as promising anti-infective biomaterials capable of physically entrapping bacteria. Synthetic β-hairpin antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been shown to form amyloid fibrils in response to bacterial endotoxins such as LPS and LTA as nucleation sites. In this work, we present a strategy to fine-tune fibril morphology through a designed peptide modulator, BTT1-3A-7S. This modulator co-assembles with the parent AMP BTT1-3A and selectively restricts longitudinal fibril growth, leading to denser and more efficient nanonets. All atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations were performed for antimicrobial peptides in interaction with bacterial cell envelopes, which indicated that the modulator introduces kinetic barriers to fibril elongation while being thermodynamically driven to co-incorporate into the fibril through stabilized peptide-peptide interactions.
