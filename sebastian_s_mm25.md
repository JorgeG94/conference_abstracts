## Abstract
BODIPY dyes have emerged as a challenge for many Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) methods. Almost all DFT methods overestimate the absorption energies of BODIPY dyes. No one has yet identified solutions for this overestimation problem. Our own group developed a class of spin-scaled double-hybrid functionals exclusively for excited state calculations.(1) These methods have never been tested on BODIPY dyes before. Herein we present our benchmark study on BODIPY’s absorptions with 28 different DFT methods.(2) Our study showed that most spin-scaled double hybrids give significantly better results closer to the experimental absorption references without overestimation. We also evidenced the same results with emissions. Therefore, we suggest DFT users to utilize our recommendations for the computational treatment of BODIPY dyes.
