## Abstract
Materials play an important role in our societies, ancient and modern. Conventional materials design faces several fundamental challenges: vast candidate spaces, expensive measurements, and fragmented knowledge. Advances in machine learning (ML) are shifting materials R&D into efficient data-driven paths using compact representations, calibrated surrogate models, and active learning. Combined with high-throughput experiments, ML is significantly enabling faster, more reliable materials innovation.
