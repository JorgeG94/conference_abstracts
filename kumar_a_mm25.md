## Abstract
Metal ions are vital cofactors for protein stability and function, yet predicting how mutations alter their coordination remains challenging. We present mCSM-Metal, a deep learning framework that integrates protein language model embeddings from ESMBind with graph-based structural signatures, residue environment features, and metal coordination geometry to predict the impact of single and multiple point mutations on the binding affinity of seven essential metal ions. mCSM-Metal achieves state-of-the-art performance (MCC up to 0.95; accuracy up to 0.97), reliably distinguishing mutations that weaken, strengthen, or preserve metal coordination. The  webserver delivers residue-level mechanistic insights and interactive 3D visualisations, supporting protein engineering, functional annotation, and clinical variant interpretation. mCSM-Metal is freely accessible at https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/mcsm_metal and via a programmatic API.
