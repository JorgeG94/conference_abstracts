## Abstract
Phosphine (PH3) is a widely used fumigant, known for its high toxicity and volatility. Thus, reliable sensing is essential to prevent unsafe exposure to humans [1]. Spinel-structured high-entropy oxides (HEOs), which incorporate five transition metals in an equimolar ratio, have emerged as promising gas sensitive materials due to their exceptional structural stability, tunable electronic properties, and rich surface chemistry [2]. To characterize the sensing behavior of (FeNiCrCoMn)3O4 toward PH3, we employ density functional theory, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations in combination with machine learning techniques. These provide insights into the adsorption energetics, charge transfer, and gas sensing reaction mechanism to help determine the suitability of HEOs as a gas sensitive layer.
