## Abstract
Antibiotic/antiseptic resistance is a pressing global health challenge, and there is an urgent need for innovative strategies to combat resistance mechanisms. Multidrug efflux pumps are promising drug targets, as their inhibition impedes antibiotic/antiseptic efflux simultaneously. For many multidrug efflux pumps, neither the precise drug binding mechanism nor their physiological role are known. QacA confers resistance to S. aureus by efflux of quaternary ammonium compounds out of bacterial membranes. Using molecular dynamics enhanced by metadynamics, we simulated the transport of three clinical and one novel substrate through QacA. Analysis revealed discrete low-energy binding sites for all substrates, hinting at future residues to be targeted in QacA inhibitor design. Finally, we are the first to show that PE lipids are likely substrates of QacA, and we anticipate the methods reported here will be powerful in unveiling mechanistic insights into other multidrug efflux proteins.
