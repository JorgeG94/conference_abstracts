# Double-Hybrid DFT without the Headache of Huge Basis Sets

Double-hybrid density functional theory (DHDFT) is among the most 
accurate approaches in electronic structure theory, but its application is 
often limited by the need for very large basis sets. The main bottleneck 
is the second-order perturbation term, which converges slowly with basis 
set size. In this talk, I will show how adding explicit correlation (F12 
methods) removes this barrier. Using representative functionals such as 
B2GP-PLYP-F12-D3(BJ) and revDSD-PBEP86-F12-D4, tested across 
the broad GMTKN55 benchmark, we find that small basis sets like ccpVDZ-F12 can already achieve accuracy on par with very large 
conventional sets, often without requiring augmentation. Beyond this, I 
will highlight how localized pair natural orbital (PNO-F12) approximations 
dramatically reduce storage and computational costs, making doublehybrid DFT feasible for larger and more complex molecules. Together, 
these advances bring double-hybrid accuracy within practical reach for 
problems ranging from thermochemistry and kinetics to noncovalent 
interactions and vibrational spectroscopy.
