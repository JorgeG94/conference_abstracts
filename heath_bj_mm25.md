## Abstract
Excited-state complexes (exciplexes) and excited-state dimers (excimers) are bound through non-covalent interactions (NCIs) including charge transfer, polarization, Pauli repulsion, electrostatics, London dispersion and excitonic splitting (in the case of excimers). The overall interaction energy of a system can be split into these smaller components through energy decomposition analysis (EDA). The second-generation EDA method based on the Absolutely Localised Molecular Orbitals (ALMO-EDA) was chosen as it has a physically sound definition for calculating excited states and claims that each component has a complete basis-set limit. [1, 2] This study explores the basis set dependence of ALMO-EDA in addition to a benchmark of various functionals with excited state species based on ALMO-EDA.
